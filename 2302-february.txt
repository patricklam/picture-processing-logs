hey, I finally fixed videos on my gallery (by cloning the videojs plugin from its github source)

Anyway the kakapo is a nocturnal flightless parrot in NZ. The population was down to 55 at its lowest point but is now up to 249 due to dedicated work by the Department of Conservation. It's basically impossible for normal people to see a live kakapo, unless Sirocco goes on tour. Maybe one day I can volunteer with kakapo recovery efforts. There's a applied math prof at Vic who does research on many things including kakapo.
There is a new paper about kakapo recovery, illustrated here: https://sci.kiwi/@digs/109816463663885983
Also, there was a documentary about NZ conservation efforts:
