Nearly all surveillance data systems are built on the archaic, and now obsolete, notion that accounting for cases, hospitalization, and death in the acute phase is sufficient to capture the health burden of the infection. This approach does not account for the burden of long-term health loss due to infectious illnesses, which obscures their true toll.

books:

Native Birds of New Zealand by David Hallett: Oops, I already own this book, but presumably my copy is in Canada. Anyway, it still has excellent bird pictures of almost all of the NZ birds.

Sarah Ell. Lost Wonders: Vanished Creatures of Aotearoa.

This is a fairly recent book (2020) about animals and plants that are extinct or in danger of extinction 
in Aotearoa New Zealand, starting with dinosaurs and including the well-known stories (in NZ) of the kakapo and 
black robin (hence including Chatham Island). Birds are of course the most charismatic of the NZ wildlife,
but the book also discusses trees, lizards, fish, and whales. Because it was settled so recently, NZ has more 
than its share of extinct yet documented creatures, unfortunately. People didn't even really consider it to be
a problem until recently, and even now, conservation often takes second place to economic development.
That's especially true in Australia (see: swift parrot) but not absent from NZ (see: cameras on fishing boats
under the current government). Although we haven't documented any losses of birds recently (the South Island 
kokako being perhaps or perhaps not extinct), some birds are really barely hanging on, like the fairy tern.
NZ does deploy significant resources to save the famous species like kakapo, but the Department of Conservation
isn't really well funded, and it's always a struggle.
