book review:

## Books

What If? 2 by Randall Munroe

"Additional serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions"

Entertaining read. People come up with the oddest questions. I haven't read the
first book, but I guess this is more of the same? It is like xkcd, but there 
is more text. The chapters are short, science-based, and yet zany. It does
take surprisingly long to get through 300 pages of short chapters.

## Online courses

I don't even like online courses but I'm doing 3 hybrid courses right now!
