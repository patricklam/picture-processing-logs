Books:
Kerry-Jayne Wilson: NZ Seabirds: A Natural History

Encyclopedic book about our state of knowledge about NZ Seabirds as of 2021. Some excellent pictures
from the usual photographers. Discussion of birds' migration, feeding, biology and breeding, and conservation.
It's tough to be a seabird, and it's tough to study a seabird since we're stuck either on land or on boats.
Though it's still hard enough to preserve the NZ fairy tern, which is still a shore bird.

Broad-billed prions and Chatham petrels are both rare, but the prions steal burrows from the petrels, killing 
petrel chicks and causing the petrels to "desert their burrow and break their pair bond"; they then need to find 
another partner and breed successfully, which takes another season or two. The author and her student developed
burrow flaps to keep prions out (made from neoprene wetsuit offcuts).
