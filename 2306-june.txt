Brian Parkinson. Explore New Zealand Nature: A Natural History Road Trip. 2022.

Parkinson describes, of course, birds, but also trees, weta, and sometimes rocks all around New Zealand. He also 
points out the natural *history* part, where there used to be a lot more birds than there are now, especially the 
huia. He provides a fairly comprehensive tour of New Zealand. I really have been to most of the places that he 
describes, plus some others---especially the ones that aren't accessible by road. Some of the places (e.g. Mana 
Island) are normally inaccessible to normal people.

Doing this as actual road trips would be, for me, the worst. But I definitely would be interested in stopping by 
some of these places for a second visit should I happen to be in the neighbourhood. Probably I wouldn't actually 
see many of the birds he mentions. But it's worth a try. And I could learn more about trees. I know many birds, 
but I'm pretty hopeless with NZ plants.

This book looks to be worth owning outright; the blessing and the curse of the library book is that you're not 
supposed to keep it. That's great when it's one-time-use, less so when it's reference material.
