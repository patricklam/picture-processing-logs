September 2-5: Napier

Escaping the rain to sunny Napier. Exceeded expectations.

* Ahuriri Estuary Walk
* Te Mata Peak
* Bell Rock Track

plus two farmers' markets but not the Waipukurau Spring Fling which had tons of people.

Rented a midlife-crisis-red Mazda Demio from Omega which was slightly more upscale than our green Mazda 2 (remote lock).
Got about 5.8L/100km, which is maybe a bit better than the Mazda 2.

Sep 9-11: Moetueka

Donuts & South Island Championships
