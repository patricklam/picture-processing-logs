The Bone People by Keri Hulme

This classic of Aotearoa literature, described by its publishers as "a MƒÅori novel," feels surprisingly modern in outlook in some ways (raise your kids with empathy and not by beating them) despite being 39 years from publication. In other ways not so much (so much 
smoking!). The three protagonists are tremendously flawed, but towards the end, go through healing journeys, and, even if not fully healed of their physical ailments, are psychically made whole. And yet, despite the book being modern in some ways, it is about life in 
small-town and off the grid in rural New Zealand, a life that is not the life of the 30% of New Zealanders that live in the super city, Auckland (which is still pretty small on a world scale). The land itself is a presence in the book; while I've not lived in New Zealand 
for very long, some of the descriptions resonate with me. Part of the characters' arc is about working out their connection, as Maori, to the land, in the modern era. But the book's worldwide popularity also suggests that people get something out of it when they are on the 
other side of the world from Aotearoa; I was able to borrow it from the Waterloo Public Library (though only found time to read the version I checked out from the Wellington City Library).
